The XKCD Browser is an iOS app for browsing XKCD comics! You can browse comics while offline, save your favorite comics, and share comics with your friends! You can search for comics by keyword - the app allows you to search not only just the title, but also the comic contents as well! And unlike the web browser mobile site, you can easily view the alt text for all the comics.

All comics are sourced from https://xkcd.com and are drawn by Randall Munroe.
